# Equity Journal

I came away from the ECS Phase 2 PD energized by the work around equity and with
the nagging sense that I didn't really "get it" – there seemed to be a lot of
nuance to actually implementing the equity component of the curriculum and while
I'd come away with several good ideas, I didn't feel equipped to develop my own
ideas. This journal is a place to track my process as I work on making the
process of teaching for equity my own.

## Equitable Practices

Recognizing and honoring the computational thinking that my students already do.

Designing activities with roles for everybody. Making each role essential to the
success of the group.

Teaching students to be intentional in selecting their roles in the group.
This means for students to think about what they need to do to get the most out
of the group activity. It also means for students to think about which roles
other members of the group need to take on.

Recognizing different learning styles.

Intentionally structuring groups.

Planning activities that are culturally relevant to students. Honoring groups
that are not usually "front and center".
