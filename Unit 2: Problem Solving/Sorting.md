* Equity

Sorting examples from personal experience.

Roles - teach how to use roles to support learning. Have students think about
what they need in the process. Who needs to do the hands on part? Who can do the
observing and documenting well?

** Warm Up

** Roles During Inquiry

Teach groups to reflect on and assign roles based on the needs of the group.
Who needs to do the hands on part?
Who has some knowledge about sorting and can use that to facilitate observing and
note taking.

* Inquiry

* Computer Science

Find ways to sort a group of items (bags, light to heavy).
Describe algorithms.
Analyze performance
- How do we descibe/quantitize efficenty

** Extention

Which sorts are more or less efficent?
How do we characterize the efficency of the sort?
Which cases are suited to which kinds of sorts?
