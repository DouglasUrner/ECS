Exploring Computer Science (ECS) is a year-long introduction to computer science. No previous experience with computers or programming is required. All you need is your curiosity.

### Course Overview

Units:

1. Human Computer Interaction
1. Problem Solving
1. Web Design
1. Introduction to Programming
1. Computing and Data Analysis
1. Robotics

### Assessment

Throughout the course students employ six computational practices that recur through all of the units. These practices are the basis of assessment in the class. Each practice is weighted and your score is based on all six. The goal is to encourage you to develop strength across all of the areas.

* Analyze the effects of developments in computing.
* Design and implement creative solutions and artifacts.
* Apply abstractions and models.
* Analyze your computational work and the work of others.
* Communicate computational thought processes, procedures, and results to others.
* Collaborate with peers on computing activities.

These practices are challenging – getting good at them is a worthy goal. There is nothing wrong with starting at the beginning, that is where you build the foundation that enables you to go farther. Scoring in this course is done on a 4-point scale.

1. **Foundation:**  the work we’re looking at as evidence shows knowledge of the “facts” and comprehension of what they mean.
1. **Application:** you are able to use your foundational knowledge and skill in new situations to solve relevant problems.
1. **Analysis:** your work shows evidence of careful examination – you have identified causes & can make inferences and generalizations that are supported with evidence.
1. **Synthesis & Evaluation:** you are able use your understanding to discover new patterns or alternative solutions. You can make judgments about the quality and/or effectiveness of a piece of work based on a set of criteria.

As you get better at these practices you are welcome (and encouraged) to reassess to improve your scores.

### Expectations

To come to class regularly, and to make up work promptly when you have to miss class.

To value your own learning process and respect the learning process of your classmates.

To use technology appropriately, and to leave our space in better condition that you found it.

To respect our class norms.
